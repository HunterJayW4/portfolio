          Iâ€™m a programmer at heart, and this was my first time diving deep into the world of hardware.
          Before this course, I had only taken two Electrical Engineering classes. Still, I wanted to
          pay homage to a video game classic â€” <span className="text-white font-semibold">Pong</span> â€” and bring it to life from the bare metal.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-slate-300 mb-6">
          I soldered potentiometer-based joysticks (burned my fingers in the process ðŸ”¥), figured out how to
          interface them with the STM32 chip, and wrote all the logic to relay input to the LCD. The game
          was programmed entirely in <span className="text-teal-300">C</span>, a language I had only touched a few times before.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-slate-300 mb-6">
          I also had to solve the physics behind the bouncing ball â€” which ended up being simpler than expected â€”
          and bring together everything under real-time constraints. With only three weeks to source the parts and build
          the whole thing, this project pushed me hard. But itâ€™s also the university project Iâ€™m most proud of.

          Built from scratch. No engines. Just wires, code, and a whole lot of learning.
